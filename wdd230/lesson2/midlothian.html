      <h2 class="midlo">About Midlothian, VA</h2>
      <p>Midlothian is a suburban community located in Chesterfield and Powhatan Counties. Founded over 300 years ago as a coal 
         mining village, located west of Richmond, and South of the James River in the Richmond-Petersburg region.</p>
      <p>The Village area of Midlothian started as a settlement of coal miners in the 18th century. Midlothian produced the first 
        commercially mined coal in the United States. According to research by the author Bettie W. Weaver, some of the first coal 
        mines were controlled by the wealthy Wooldridge family. Wooldridge brothers came to Virginia from Scotland and built their 
        home nearby. In developing their new business in Virginia, they compromised on the name, naming their family-owned business 
        "Mid-Lothian Mining Company". The name was associated with the unincorporated town which grew in the area, and became used 
        as one word: "Midlothian."</p>
      <p>During the American Revolution, coal produced in the Midlothian coal pits supplied the cannon factory on the James River 
        at Westham, upstream from Richmond and produced shot and shells for the Continental Army. By the end of the War, developers 
        shipped Chesterfield coal to Philadelphia, New York and Boston. Commenting on the area's coal in his Notes on the State of 
        Virginia (1781–82), then-Governor Thomas Jefferson said: "The country on James river, from 15 to 20 miles above Richmond, 
        and for several miles northward and southward, is replete with mineral coal of a very excellent quality." During his presidency, 
        Jefferson ordered coal from the Black Heath Mine in Midlothian for use in the White House.</p>

      <h2 class="midlo">Top 50 Places to live in 2020</h2>
      <p>History buffs will love Midlothian, a suburb located 14 miles from Richmond. The city is home to 10 historic landmarks, 
         including the Dinwiddie County Pullman Car — an all-steel railcar built in 1926 — and Hallsborough Tavern, an 18th century inn. 
         Both are listed on the National Register of Historical Places.</p>
      <p>For faster-paced fun, there’s Windy Hills Sports, an entertainment complex boasting mini-golf, batting cages and go-karts. There’s
         even a lush “footgolf” course where soccer and golf combine — just kick the ball into each of the 18 holes, and try to beat par.</p>
      <p>Midlothian’s 8.2% unemployment rate was well below the national average in June, which clocked in at 11.1% for the same period 
         thanks to COVID-19. Since 2015, employment has jumped 11% in the city, and it’s expected to rise another 3% by 2025. Amazon (which
         has several warehouses in the area) and the city’s Bon Secours St. Francis Hospital are two of the city’s major employers.</p>
